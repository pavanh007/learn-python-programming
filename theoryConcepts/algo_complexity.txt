BIG-0 : best for time and space complextiy

constant time : always same, ex: fetch using 
linear time : based on input to operation perform
logarithmic time: based on splitting single operation in micro functions
Quadratic time: nested loop condition
Exponential time: fibanocci number is prime example for this
